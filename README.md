# Tree Tapper
Tree Tapper is a new type of idle game, based on Flutter 2. Through the option of interactive video ads, users can not only earn in-game rewards, but also plant actual, real-life trees at the same time. The game features a deep progression system and keeps track of the number of trees planted by each user in order to provide a shareable experience that remains engaging in the long term.
